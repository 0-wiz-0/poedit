              a cross-platform gettext catalogs editing tool


 About
=======

This program is GUI frontend to GNU gettext utilities (win32 version
is part of the distribution) and catalogs editor/source code parser. It helps
with translating application into another language. For details on principles
of the solution used, see GNU gettext documentation or wxWidgets' wxLocale 
class reference.


 Installing
============

Binary easily-installable packages are provided for Windows and OS X and are
part of many Linux distributions.


 Installing from sources
=========================

Requirements:

  * Boost
  * Unicode build of wxWidgets library, version >= 2.8.7
    (see http://www.wxwidgets.org)
  * Berkeley DB >= 4.1 if you need translation memory
  * If on Unix, GtkSpell 2.x plus GTK+ 2 build of wxWidgets for spell
    checking support


 Unix and OS X/Windows using GNU toolchain
-------------------------------------------

Do the usual thing:
    ./configure
    make
    make install
This works on OS X (which is a standard BSD Unix system) and Windows with
MinGW toolchain and MSYS shell installed. You must have the dependencies
installed in a location configure will find, e.g. by setting CPPFLAGS and
LDFLAGS appropriately.

Win32 version is distributed as precompiled binary with gettext utilities
included. You don't need wxWidgets for it. If you want to compile Poedit
yourself, then the best way is to install Mingw and MSYS and use Unix
way of building the library.


 Mac OS X
----------

After compiling the application as above, you can additionally create an OS X
bundle by running "make bundle" in the src/ subdirectory. This requires that
GETTEXT_PREFIX environment variable is set and points to a directory with
compiled GNU gettext programs installed (e.g. msgfmt; GETTEXT_PREFIX=/opt/local
works if you used MacPorts to install gettext and so msgfmt is in
/opt/local/bin/msgfmt). Finally, running "make dist-osx" in the toplevel
directory will create disk image with the bundle.


 Windows using Visual Studio 2005 Express
------------------------------------------

Visual Studio makefile is in win32/ directory. Change to this directory
and run "nmake -f makefile.vc [additional options]". The flags to set are
documented near the top of the makefile. In particular, you have to set the
WX_DIR variable to point to wxWidgets installation (by default, WXWIN
environment variable is used), WXRC variable to point to wxWidget's wxrc.exe,
point DB_PATH to Berkeley DB tree with compiled static library and set
DB_VERSION to the version you use, if it differs from the setting in the
makefile.

Once the program is compiled, you may wish to create the installer. Inno Setup
is used for installation on Windows and it's made to use the VS2005 binaries.
In order to compile the installer, you must first copy gettext binaries to
deps/gettext directory - if you don't, the installer will report errors.


 Installing from Git repository
--------------------------------

If you get the sources directly from the Git repository, some generated files
are not present. You have to run the ./bootstrap script to create them. After
that, continue according to the instructions above.

The ./bootstrap script requires some additional tools to be installed:

 * AsciiDoc, xsltproc and xmlto to generate the manual page
 * Bakefile, to generate Windows makefiles/projects
 * ImageMagick and png2icns from libicns to generate icons in Windows and
   OS X native formats

If you don't have any of the dependencies, ./bootstrap will print errors, but
will continue to run. In other words, if you don't need e.g. Windows stuff, you
can ignore Windows-specific dependencies.

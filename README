              a cross-platform Gettext catalogs editing tool


 About
-------

This program is GUI frontend to GNU Gettext utilities (win32 version
is part of the distribution) and catalogs editor/source code parser. It helps
with translating application into another language. For details on principles
of the solution used, see GNU Gettext documentation or wxWindows' wxLocale 
class reference.


 Installing
------------

poEdit is built on top of wxWindows toolkit, so it requires it at 
compilation time (version 2.6.0 or newer, see http://www.wxwindows.org).
Additional requirements are Berkeley DB >= 3 if you need translation memory
and GtkSpell 2.x plus GTK+ 2 build of wxWindows for spellchecking support
(Unix only).

Under Unix, do "./configure && make && make install" as usual.

Win32 version is distributed as precompiled binary with Gettext utilities
included. You don't need wxWindows for it. If you want to compile poEdit
yourself, then the best way is to install Mingw and MSYS and use Unix
way of building the library.

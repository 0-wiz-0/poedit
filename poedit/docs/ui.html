<h1>User Interface Overview</h1>

The image bellow shows poEdit's editing environment:

<p>
Don't get scared by poEdit's user interface. Its list control is modified
so that it is easier to navigate the catalog. When you select an item
in list control (e.g. by clicking on it), focus is taken from list control
and given to the "translation" text control. This behavior makes editing 
easier and faster.

<p>
Use up/down arrows and PgUp/PgDown to navigate in
list of messages and alphanumerical keys to enter string. Original string 
is shown below the list of strings and translation is just below it 
(separated from list by splitter so that you can adjust listbox:text 
controls height radio). The new translation you typed in is copied into
the catalog and list control when you select another item in the list
or when you save the file.

<p>
In the image above you can see that some items have different color. 
This is meant to simplify navigation in the catalog -- untranslated strings
are marked with blue color and are always at the beginning of the list.
Yellow color is used to mark fuzzy translations (see 
<a href="basics.html">poEdit and Gettext Basics</a> if you don't know what 
it means). You will notice that `not translated' and `fuzzy' marking is 
changed when edit translation, so you needn't worry about it in most cases.

<p>
You can right-click on focused item to display list of
references (i.e. places in source code where given string appears) and 
open the file that contains given string. This is useful if you are not
sure in what context is the string used. Same functionality is available
via <a>Edit/Show references</a> menu command.

<p>
See <a href="menu.html">Menu and Toolbar</a> for description of toolbar icons.

High priority:

- make list control customizable: optionally display only "original string" column
  (suggested by Mladen Mintakovic)

- make list control font customizable!!
  (ditto text controls)

- make it possible to *read* comments, not only edit them. Mattias suggested 
  that a tooltip popups near the "pen" icon in the list if you hold mouse over 
  it, but this can't be implemented because 1) wxMSW won't let you set 
  listctrl's popup and 2) wxGTK displays the popup _under_ control, 
  i.e. for from the "pen" icon
  update: possible solution would be to use wxPopupWindow

- use virtual wxListCtrl
- plural handling (in wxWin, too), see info:/gettext/PO Files
- remember the exact way msgid/msgstr was stored (where the boundaries between 
  multiple lines are) and save it like that unless modified.

Lower priority:

- spell-checker interface (ispell, aspell)   [Vadim]
- automatic translation via web services     [Vadim]
  (Babelfish and Perl/Python script to parse it; maybe Google SOAP)

- statistics (# of words, # of characters)
- Add parsing of msgfmt's error output (e.g. msgid "foo\n" msgstr "foo" will 
  produce fatal error about \n mismatch)
- TM should split input string into sentences before querying db
- OnResize should move the sash so that its distance from bottom edge stays same
- shared databases for multiple users?
- reading MO files directly
- handling of POT files (as an alternative to home-grown scanning)
- configurable file extension of .mo file (.gmo)
- when saving po files, write more references on one line

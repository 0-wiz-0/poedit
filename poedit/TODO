Urgent:

- add i18n support to poEdit *itself*
- use slightly different colour for odd and even entries in the listbox
  (see KDE's file open dialog)
- use virtual wxListCtrl


Lower priority:

- Add parsing of msgfmt's error output (e.g. msgid "foo\n" msgstr "foo" will produce
  fatal error about \n mismatch)
- Regular Unicode build of poEdit (wxUSE_UNICODE=1), ship both poedit_a.exe
  and poedit_u.exe and decide between them at installation time
- TM should split input string into sentences before querying db
- OnResize should move the sash so that its distance from bottom edge stays same
- shared databases for multiple users?
- reading MO files directly
- handling of POT files (as an alternative to home-grown scanning)
- configurable file extension of .mo file (.gmo)
- add a sample .po file
- when saving po files, write more references on one line

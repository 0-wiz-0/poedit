- progress bar (percentage of translated messgaes)

- add a sample .po file

- when writing date into po file, do not use %z, it is gnu
  only. Instead, use wxDateTime and zone info to write it.

- \n handling: when saving msgid and msgstr, replace \\n by \\n\n
  and do the same thing when displaying it

- "Search" dialog (with a checkbox "search in translated or
  untranslated strings").

- line numbers in the source file viewer. 

- An entry to edit the file (with a configurable editor
  as, apparently, not everybody likes vi ;-) would be nice
  
- [idea] incremental I/O:
  when saving a catalog, do not overwrite the file but instead
  _replace_ things in it, leaving things it doesn't understand 
  (such as comments) untouched

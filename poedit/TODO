Urgent:

- add i18n support to poEdit *itself*
- regular Unicode build of poEdit (wxUSE_UNICODE=1), using unicows.dll
- automated translation during update should be marked as fuzzy!
- use virtual wxListCtrl
- plural handling (in wxWin, too), see info:/gettext/PO Files
- remember the exact way msgid/msgstr was stored (where the boundaries between multiple
  lines are) and save it like that unless modified.


Lower priority:

- statistics (# of words, # of characters)
- Add parsing of msgfmt's error output (e.g. msgid "foo\n" msgstr "foo" will produce
  fatal error about \n mismatch)
- TM should split input string into sentences before querying db
- OnResize should move the sash so that its distance from bottom edge stays same
- shared databases for multiple users?
- reading MO files directly
- handling of POT files (as an alternative to home-grown scanning)
- configurable file extension of .mo file (.gmo)
- add a sample .po file
- when saving po files, write more references on one line

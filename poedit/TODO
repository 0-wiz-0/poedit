- There's a bug in traversing dirs when updating db under win32
- TM should split input string into sentences before querying db
- OnResize should move the sash so that its distance from bottom edge stays same
- fix default location of TM DB on Win32
- shared databases for multiple users?
- bugfix: new empty catalog. Insert orig. string says "cannot get info from item 0"
  (listctrl), right-click promptly crashes 
- rename "Insert original string" to something less confusing
- add an option to manually add string to the catalog
- reading MO files directly
- comments editing
- catalogs manager
- handling of POT files (as an alternative to home-grown scanning)
- configurable file extension of .mo file (.gmo)
- progress bar (percentage of translated messgaes)
- add a sample .po file
- line numbers in the source file viewer. 
- An entry to edit the file (with a configurable editor
  as, apparently, not everybody likes vi ;-) would be nice
- combobox for changing ref. line in references viewer
- when saving po files, write more references on one line
- add i18n support to poEdit *itself*
- use Scintilla for syntax highlighting (\n, \r etc., spaces) (?)

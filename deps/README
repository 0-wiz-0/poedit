  Introduction
================

This directory contains all 3rd party dependencies needed to build Poedit.
It's typically not needed on Linux, where all the dependencies are commonly
available, but it comes handy when compiling for Windows and OS X.

Note that some sources are slightly patched, too.


  Windows requirements
========================

In order to build the dependencies on Windows, you will need to have the
following installed:

1. Sun JDK (for Ant; JRE is not enough)
2. Apache Ant, e.g. from http://code.google.com/p/winant/
3. MinGW with MSYS shell from http://www.mingw.org/wiki/MinGW
4. Visual C++ 2008 (the free Express edition suffices)

MinGW is only needed to build GNU gettext utilities, you may opt to copy them
to bin-gettext/bin/ directory from existing Poedit installation instead.

  Installing MinGW
--------------------

Follow the instructions from http://www.mingw.org/wiki/Getting_Started to
install basic MinGW system. Make sure the shell (MSYS) is enabled, as well as
both C and C++ components.

Once installed, run the MinGW Shell from the Start menu. Now use the
"mingw-get" tool to install some additional tools that Poedit build uses:

 $ mingw-get install mingw-developer-toolkit


  How to build the dependencies
=================================

Once you have the prerequisites all installed, open a shell, change to this
directory, and type "ant". That's it.
